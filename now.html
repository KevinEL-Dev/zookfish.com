    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>Updated 2026-02-20</p>

    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>
      Today I went to the gym and hit legs. Today was more of a high rep and lighter workout to go easy on my joints.
    </p>
    <h2>Panda Express</h2>

    <p>
      Got some panda express today! Recently I had a presentation at school and it went well so I felt I had to treat
      myself. To stay within my macros I got:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Half super greens</li>
      <li>Half chow mein</li>
      <li>Honey sesame chicken</li>
      <li>Teriyaki chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Macros came out to be around 910 calories but I only ate breakfast so I stayed within my deficit.
    </p>
    <h2>Rust cli update</h2>
    <p>Made some progress in my rust cli project that monitors Hytale’s processes and returns a digestible view of how
      much resources its consuming in a sense.</p>
    <p>The cli will return, if prompted to monitor cpu usage, the average amount of cpu cores used over x time.</p>
    <p>This information isn’t useful yet considering the user needs to know overall how the system is performing before
      deciding if a bottleneck is at play.</p>
    <p>
      I also added a readme and a MIT license.
    </p>
    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>
      Got a soccer game that I’m going to tomorrow so that should be fun and also very hot.
