    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>Updated 2026-02-18</p>

    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>
      Today I went to the gym and worked out my arms. The workout was good, did a new exercise for my triceps and I
      think I will add it to my routine.
    </p>
    <h2> Rust project dark realization</h2>
    <p>
      I’m currently still working on a rust cli, and hopefully daemon, tool that will provide hytale server owners a way
      to see how much resources over x time is being used by hytale. The program should also provide a way to interpret
      why the hytale server spikes in usage of a system resource based on the logs provided by the hytale process.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in my last update I found a command that I thought provided the total cpu% utilization under the parent process
      of hytale.

    </p>
    <p>Below is the command:</p>

    <p>top -b -d 1 -n 2 | awk '$1 == "PID" {block_num++; next} block_num == 2 {sum += $9;} END {print sum}'</p>

    <p>Top does not show a tree of processes unlike htop does.</p>
    <p>
      So when I run the command above it only retrieves the one hytale process and its not doing what I expected it to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did manage to retrieve the pid for hytale but that is too much for me to get into and I’m feeling lazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing that I’m currently questioning is, if I wanted to know how intensive a hytale server is. Is
      retrieving every cpu% from the parent hytale process and all its children an accurate way to reflect that?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I may need to do more research regarding what exactly htop is showing me. To help me determine a good way
      to show how your system is performing when hytale is running
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, I think I’m back in the planning phase of either trying to figure out a better way determine how
      intensive a hytale server.
