    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>Updated 2026-02-24</p>

    <h2>Installed arch linux and hyprland</h2>
    <p>My macbook has 8gb of ram and runs out when I have a lot of tabs open and when I am coding at the same time</p>
    <p>I remember that I bought a refurbished thinkpad t480 for like $100-150 usd and decided that I will take off linux mint and get arch linux with hyprland on this bad boy. Soon realized that this has 16gb of ram.</p>
    <p>So to switch it up I decided to follow the arch install wiki instead of a youtube tutorial and took a lot longer that expected</p>
    <p>I really only had to search up how to fix grub but realized that I forgot to generate the grub config file. Also ran into issues setting up hyprland considering they say not to use uwsm anymore so I got lost there</p>

    <p>It's like 2am and have spent the majority of this time setting up the laptop for dev work</p>

    <p>This update has been made from my thinkpad t480 on arch.</p>
