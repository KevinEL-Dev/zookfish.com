    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>Updated 2026-02-17</p>

    <h2>Changing daily calorie distribution</h2>
    <p>My caloric deficit in MacroFactor has decreased by 80 calories. To accommodate this I will be eating less during
      the morning so that I can eat more food during the latter half of the day.</p>
    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>Hit legs today and it was a pretty good session. My top set for bulgarian split squats I did 95lb for 8 on both
      left and right leg.
    </p>
    <h2>More updates regarding rust cli/daemon project</h2>
    <p>So in order for my program to monitor how much resources hytale is using I need to know every hytale process that
      is running and take the sum cpu%. This seems like a lot of work but for now I found a command that should get the
      job done.
    </p>
    <p>top -b -d 1 -n 2 | awk '$1 == "PID" {block_num++; next} block_num == 2 {sum += $9;} END {print sum}'</p>
    <p>This command basically runs top, where top then prints a first snapshot of all processes. Top then waits a second
      and then prints another snapshot of the processes. From there we pipe that output and use awk. I heard of awk but
      I forgot what it does. For now I know that it does take the cpu% of each process that has the PID and its
      children.
    </p>
    <p>This will be the plan to try and get the cpu% of all hytale processes and its children. So the first step is that
      I need to get the PID of the parent hytale process. We just use the command:
    </p>
    <p>ps aux | grep java -XX:AOTCache=HytaleServer.aot</p>
    <p>This will include the grep process as well so we pipe this into the command:</p>
    <p>head -n 1</p>
    <p>This should give us the parent process that hytale runs.</p>
    <h2>Playing soccer today</h2>
    <p>Club that I am a part of is having some soccer games so I will partake.</p>
    <h2>Blaze pizza</h2>
    <p>After playing some soccer, I will probably go to blaze if it doesnt close. Probably will get a half pie with
      chicken and bbq.</p>
