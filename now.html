    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
    <p>Updated 2026-02-16</p>

    <h2>Pushed some changes to my rust project</h2>
    <p>Currently I am working on creating a cli/daemon program written in rust. The main goal of this project is to
      provide hytale server owners a quick way to monitor their server. Basically htop but tailored to watch activity
      from Hytale.
    </p>
    <p> What I did exactly was I just added more commands to the cli portion of the program. You can pass in system
      resource (cpu, memory, or network) and a time in seconds. The program will return system usuage over x seconds.
    </p>
    <p> The plan is for the program to parse htyale logs for things like players joining, players leaving, and other
      actions like theses. From there the program will match these actions to system resource spikes. So, if a player
      joins and the cpu spikes, the program will give you that inforamtion in like a timeline.
    </p>
